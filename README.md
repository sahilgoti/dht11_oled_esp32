# ESP32 Temperature and Humidity Monitor with OLED Display

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller, a DHT11 sensor, and a 0.96-inch OLED display to create a simple temperature and humidity monitor. The ESP32 reads data from the DHT11 sensor and displays the readings on the OLED display in real-time.


## Features

- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
- Simple and easy-to-understand code
- Uses common components that are easy to find and inexpensive

## Components

- ESP32 Dev Board
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- 0.96-inch OLED Display
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## Instructions

1. Connect the DHT11 sensor to the ESP32 according to the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the provided code to your ESP32 using the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the serial monitor to view the temperature and humidity readings.
4. The OLED display will show the temperature and humidity readings in real-time.
